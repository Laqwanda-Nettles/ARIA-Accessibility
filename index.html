        ARIA is acronym for Accessible Rich Internet Applications. It is a set
        of roles and attributes that can be added to HTML elements to describe a
        meaning or purpose of user interface. ARIA makes web content and
        applications more accessible for people with disabilities and those who
        use assistive technology.
