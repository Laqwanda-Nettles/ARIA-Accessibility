      <p aria-labelledby="define-aria">
        ARIA is acronym for Accessible Rich Internet Applications. ARIA was
        deveoloped in 2008 by the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) group. It's
        not a true programming language but rather a set of attributes you can
        add to HTML elements to increase their accessibility. These attributes
        communicate role, state, and property to assistive technology. ARIA
        doesn't change an element's functionality or visual appearence on it
        own. Meaning only those who use assistive technology will notice the
        difference between ones using ARIA and ones that are not. As developers
        it's our resposiblilty to make our web applications more accessible.
        Simply put, ARIA makes web content and applications more accessible for
        people with disabilities and those who use assistive technology.

        <p>
          There are three main features of ARIA: roles, properties and
          states/values.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Roles define what and element is or does on the page or app.</li>
          <li>
            Properties express characteristics or relationships to an object.
          </li>
          <li>
            States/ Values define the current conditions or date values
            associated with the element.
          </li>

      <h2>Common ARIA Attributes</h2>
      <p><strong>aria-label</strong> gives a name (or label) to an element.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>aria-labelledby</strong> similiar to aria-label, it also changes
        the element's name/label. Instead of stating the label, it points to
        another element.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>aria-describedby</strong> doesn't affect the element's label.
        Instead, it provides a description to the element.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>aria-hidden</strong> is used to hide an element from
        accessibility tools, such as screen readers, wihile still allowing it to
        be visible to sighted users. The values for this attribute is "true" or
        "false".
